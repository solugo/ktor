/**
 * This feature provides ability to invoke [ApplicationCall.receive] several times.
 * Please note that not every type could be received twice. For example, even with this feature installed you can't
 * receive a channel twice (unless [Configuration.receiveEntireContent] is enabled).
 * Types that always can be received twice or more: `ByteArray`, `String` and `Parameters`.
 * Also some of content transformation features (such as [ContentNegotiation]) could support it as well.
 * If not specified, a transformation result is not considered as reusable. So a transformation feature may
 * mark a result as reusable by proceeding with a [ApplicationReceiveRequest] instance having
 * [ApplicationReceiveRequest.reusableValue] `= true`.
 * So installing [DoubleReceive] with [ContentNegotiation] provides ability to receive a user type that will be
 * deserialized at first receive and then the same instance will be returned for every further receive invocation.
 * When the same receive type requested as the firstly received, the receive pipeline and content transformation are
 * not triggered (except when [Configuration.receiveEntireContent] = `true`).
